        <h1>My Story : <em>A new life in Canada</em></h1>
    </header>

    <p1>&nbsp;&nbsp;A year ago, I took my gap semester in Toronto. I really enjoyed the time. I met a lot of people who come from different countries, and I did special activities which only can do in Canada. I learned a lot of things not only English but also how to live indepentently. At that time, I thought I want to spend more time in Canada. <br></p1>
    <p2>&nbsp;&nbsp;Right after graduating my university life in my home country, I decided to study once again in Canada. It was a hard decision for me because usually it's time to get a regular job in my home country. Also, studying in English even in different major is a big challenge for me. Thanks to my parents' support, I'm having a great time now.</p2>
